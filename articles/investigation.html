                        BBBC examined Mr. Krabs’ business-first agenda, workplace record, and environmental promises to see how the Krabby Party platform aligns with his history at the Krusty Krab.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Finding #1: A Business-First Economy Agenda</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the rally, Krabs emphasized tax reform and getting the economy moving. The Krabby Party platform calls big business the “cornerstone” of America and argues that lower corporate taxes and fewer regulations will create jobs. Critics note that centering corporations could sideline worker protections if profits stay the top priority for a president who also runs a major local business.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Finding #2: Workers Left Holding the Patty?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Krusty Krab is famous for its patties—and infamous for penny-pinching. Bikini Bottom residents have seen SpongeBob work long hours for little pay, Squidward complain about being underpaid, and Krabs cut corners whenever profits are at stake. Paired with the Krabby Party’s pro-business platform, the pattern suggests profits first and workers hoping gains trickle down.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Finding #3: Environmental Promises vs. Past Behavior</h2>
                    <p>
                        The platform highlights climate change, renewable energy, and addressing nuclear ocean testing. But Krabs’ history shows profit often outweighing cleanliness or environmental care unless revenue is threatened. Advocates worry regulations could look strong on paper yet still leave big businesses with minimal sacrifice, especially compared to the Patty Party’s more activist cleanup stance.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Response from the Campaign</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Krabby Party says pro-business policies will lift wages by expanding jobs and claims their environmental planks balance growth with responsibility. They argue workplace practices at the Krusty Krab have evolved alongside safety standards.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Expert Analysis</h2>
                    <p>
                        Labor advocates see risks that deregulation could weaken wage growth and safety protections. Environmental analysts caution that pairing incentives with light enforcement could slow cleanup progress.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Impact on the Race</h2>
                    <p>
                        Voters weighing pocketbook issues may welcome promises of growth but remain wary about how benefits reach workers and the environment. Poll shifts will hinge on whether Krabs addresses concerns about his track record while explaining how safeguards fit into his platform.
