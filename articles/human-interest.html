                        Good day to everyone watching. I'm reporter Plankton, broadcasting live from BBBC to share why Mr. Krabs isn't the generous leader his platform promises. This human interest report follows the moments that revealed his true priorities—and the people who paid the price for them.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Questioning a Promise of Prosperity</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Krabby Party platform opens by pledging "freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all." Yet the episode "Born Again Krabs" shows Mr. Krabs trading Spongebob's soul for just sixty-two cents. When a long-forgotten patty was found rotting under the grill, Mr. Krabs demanded it be sold anyway, putting profit above safety until customers fled and he landed in the hospital.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faced with the Flying Dutchman, Mr. Krabs briefly vowed to be generous—offering free toys, refills, and breaks—until the bills arrived. Once debt threatened his bottom line, he snapped back to old habits, nearly tearing off a patron's arm over a penny before banishing Spongebob to the Davy Jones locker in exchange for loose change.
                    </p>

                        <h3>A Moment to Remember</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
                            When asked to choose between Spongebob and the coins in his pocket, Mr. Krabs didn't hesitate—he took the sixty-two cents. It was a chilling reminder that promises of prosperity mean little when they're abandoned the second profits dip.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Everyday Exploitation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The pattern continues beyond a single supernatural bargain. In "Squid on Strike," Mr. Krabs scolded his staff for breathing on company time and handed them "paychecks" that were really invoices for standing, existing, and clocking in. Instead of paying workers for their effort, he charged them for the privilege of serving him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Fungus Among Us" paints an even grimmer picture. A spreading fungus turned the Krusty Krab into a biohazard, yet Mr. Krabs refused to address it because cleanup would cost money. Staff and customers alike were exposed as the infection swept through Bikini Bottom, showing how far he would go to avoid spending—even when health was on the line.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        These moments aren't isolated gags; they expose a mindset. By sacrificing Spongebob's freedom for pocket change and billing employees for breathing, Mr. Krabs undermines the very "opportunity" his party promises. If elected, would he protect citizens' well-being—or look for what he can sell off next?
                    </p>

                    <h2>In Their Own Words</h2>
                    <div class="question-section">
                        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1rem;">
                            "He isn't the generous boss—or candidate—he claims to be. When the bills come due, we're the ones he sends to Davy Jones."
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: right; font-weight: 600;">

                    </div>

                    <h2>The Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        For Spongebob, the cost was nearly eternal exile. For Squidward, it meant striking for basic dignity. For Bikini Bottom diners, it was exposure to a preventable outbreak. These stories resonate with voters who fear that under a Krabby administration, their own freedoms and safety could be traded away for spare change.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        By revisiting these moments, we see how quickly promises of "freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all" can collapse when greed takes the helm. As Election Day approaches, Bikini Bottom's voters must decide whether they trust Mr. Krabs to put people first—or whether his history of cutting corners says otherwise.

                            Scenes from "Born Again Krabs," "Squid on Strike," and "Fungus Among Us" remind us what's at stake: the well-being of workers and neighbors who deserve better than a leader who counts coins before people.
