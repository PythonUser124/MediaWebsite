                        Following their scripted introduction speeches, presidential candidates from both the Patty Party
                        and the Krabby Party faced rigorous questioning from the assembled press corps. BBBC reporters,
                        along with representatives from interest groups and opposing campaigns, prepared comprehensive
                        questions designed to challenge the candidates and reveal their positions, character, and readiness
                        for office.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below is our complete archive of questions prepared for the Patty Party candidates, SpongeBob SquarePants
                        (President) and Patrick Star (Vice President). These questions range from softball inquiries designed
                        to allow candidates to further their message, to hardball questions that put them on the spot, to
                        argumentative questions that challenge their positions, and personal questions about their backgrounds.
                    </p>

                            <li><strong>China:</strong> "You condemn China's human-rights abuses, yet still plan to maintain an alliance with them. How do you justify partnering with a repressive nation?"</li>

                            <li>"Your opponents say your optimism prevents you from making tough decisions. Isn't leadership more than just positivity?"</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>China:</strong> "You say that a war with China is too dangerous, but aren't we encouraging them to keep expanding their military and territorial claims by avoiding confrontation?"</li>

                            <li><strong>Israel-Palestine:</strong> "How can the U.S. force Israel to stand trial under international law when the U.S. itself is not signed to many of those courts?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Russia-Ukraine:</strong> "Your party seeks to restore Crimea to Ukraine without the use of military pressure. What makes you think Russia would ever agree?"</li>
                            <li><strong>North Korea:</strong> "Your platform relies solely on mitigating rather than subduing the effects and consequences of North Korea. Focusing on defensive technology does nothing to stop North Korea's human-rights abuses. Are you essentially accepting the status quo?"</li>

                            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> "There is a popular concern that free prescriptions could lead to overdose. How do you prevent that while at the same time keeping drugs accessible?"</li>
