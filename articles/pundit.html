                        Two BBBC commentators square off on what the final stretch means for SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs supporters.

                    <h2>Panel Transcript: SpongeBob vs. Mr. Krabs</h2>
                    <div class="question-section" style="background-color: #eef4ff; border-left-color: #4a6cf7;">
                        <p><strong>Shreyas (pro SpongeBob):</strong> Well the press conferences and rallies have concluded, now all that's needed is for the American people to choose their next president. Will they choose Spongebob or Mr Krabs?</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack (pro Krabs):</strong> Yes and its looking to be a tossup election based on our state of the art polls.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shreyas:</strong> Spongebob seemed to take some bold positions on the American economy, promising single payer healthcare and many other social programs. Many seemed tremendous for the American people.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yes he made many promises, but can he really keep them? He seemed rather flustered when asked how he would pay for these programs. Mr Krabs free market approach seemed to have more of a plan behind it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shreyas:</strong> That may be true but Mr Krabs is clearly supporting a free market for his own personal gain, as a small business owner himself, he just wants to put more money into his own pocket.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack:</strong> Regardless, Mr Krabs seems like he’ll be tough on illegal immigration, an issue many Americans have taken very seriously.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shreyas:</strong> Oh come on man, his own vice president is an immigrant, and one that has committed an array of crimes over her time in Bikini Bottom. If he really cared about illegal immigration he would kick her out, and most definitely not pick her to be his running mate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack:</strong> At least he's saying he'll do something about it. The sponge seems like hell let illegal immigrants run rampant in our country, making many feel unsafe</p>
                        <p><strong>Shreyas:</strong> Spongebob believes that these people just want a better life for themselves and their families, he wants to use our nation's status of a first world country to support those that are less fortunate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack:</strong> Mr Krabs wants to help the less fortunate as well, just not by allowing potentially dangerous people into our beautiful country.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shreyas:</strong> Lets address the elephant in the room, During the press conference vice presidential candidate Sandy Cheeks was shot in the leg and did not appear in the press conference after that. You have to feel terrible for her and her family but it's somewhat ironic considering the krabby parties support of gun rights.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yes, thoughts and prayers for her as always, however the Krabby Party has made it clear on their position and has used this instance as a way to promote gun rights. They believe that if more people were armed in that scenario, someone could have stopped the heinous attack.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shreyas:</strong> If thats what they believe then its absolutely ridiculous, their own vice presidential candidate was shot and could have died, if thats not a slap in the face to you that we need gun regulation then I dont know what is.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack:</strong> Its easy to say that now but what if someone else who was armed had stopped the assassin, gun rights would be hailed as a necessity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shreyas:</strong> Well at this point its up to the people to decide, and they can soon enough, when they choose between Spongebob and Mr Krabs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jack:</strong> Indubitably</p>

                        <p>
                            If you choose to do a panel discussion instead of (or in addition to) an op-ed, structure it like this:
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Anchor:</strong> [Opening question or topic introduction]</p>

                        <p><strong>Pundit 1:</strong> [Response]</p>

                        <p><strong>Pundit 2:</strong> [Agrees or disagrees, adds perspective]</p>

                        <p><strong>Campaign Rep (optional):</strong> [Responds if a campaign representative is part of the panel]</p>

                        <p><strong>Anchor:</strong> [Follow-up question]</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;">
                            Continue the discussion format. Pundits should respectfully disagree, debate, and offer different
                            perspectives. Make it lively and informative!
