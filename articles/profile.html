                        Meet the Patty Party ticket of SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star alongside the Krabby Party duo
                        of Mr. Krabs and Sandy Cheeks. Here’s where each team stands on the biggest issues facing Bikini
                        Bottom voters.
                    </p>

                    <div class="question-section">
                        <h3>Patty Party — SpongeBob SquarePants (President) &amp; Patrick Star (Vice President)</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Economy:</strong> SpongeBob brings the perspective of a minimum-wage worker under boss Mr.
                            Krabs. The ticket champions social welfare programs, Medicaid and SNAP expansion, higher taxes on
                            the wealthy, universal healthcare, affordable housing, and Keynesian policies to “aid the people
                            and make their lives better.” They want a higher minimum wage, strong unions, and wealth
                            redistribution through fair taxation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Social Issues:</strong> Supports gun restrictions, including background checks, firearm
                            licensing, and red flag laws that can temporarily remove access. A terror watchlist would guide
                            whether firearms are stripped from individuals seeking to buy or retain a weapon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Healthcare &amp; Drug Policy:</strong> Views healthcare as a natural right and ties drug policy
                            to public health. Backs expanded government funding for treatment and access, full Medicare
                            expansion, preservation of the Affordable Care Act, no caps on essential care, and free
                            preventative services for all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abortion:</strong> Favors legal abortion nationwide and disagrees with Dobbs v. Jackson.
                            Supports the Reproductive Freedom Act to protect access up to 28 weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Environment:</strong> Prioritizes ocean acidification and threats like superhighway
                            construction near Jellyfish Fields. Pushes emissions limits, rejoining the Paris Agreement, and
                            transparent climate reporting to safeguard Bikini Bottom and the broader world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Criminal Justice Reform:</strong> Highlights disparities affecting people of color, lower
                            income, and unhoused residents. Seeks mental health services to reduce crime, decriminalization of
                            minor offenses, shorter sentences, reduced mandatory minimums, more education in prisons, and
                            better training to reduce bias.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Education:</strong> Wants federal subsidies for trade schools, bachelor’s, and associate
                            degrees. Promotes a “pay it forward” model where graduates contribute a small share of income to
                            fund future students, with states and businesses sharing costs and receiving tax breaks. Supports
                            after-school enrichment and stronger career and technical education.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nuclear Ocean Testing:</strong> Plans medical care for affected citizens, cleanup of waste
                            within the Runnit Dome, lower import costs for essential supplies, and decontamination of
                            irradiated areas—alongside policies to make wholesome food more affordable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Immigration &amp; Foreign Policy:</strong> Seeks easier paths to citizenship and embraces
                            open borders for humans and sea creatures alike. Recognizes China’s economic role while reviewing
                            the alliance every two years. Aims to revoke funding for Israel, support nuclear disarmament and
                            refugees in Ukraine, and maintain pressure on North Korea while backing allies with defensive
                            technology.
                        </p>

                    <div class="question-section">
                        <h3>Krabby Party — Mr. Krabs (President) &amp; Sandy Cheeks (Vice President)</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Economy:</strong> Believes big business powers America and favors trickle-down economics.
                            Would roll back the National Environmental Policy Act to speed up large-scale projects, lowering
                            costs for manufacturers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Social Issues:</strong> Opposes heavy gun laws, arguing they violate individual freedoms and
                            harm the industry. Plans to reduce taxes and registration requirements for suppressors, eliminate
                            the $200 federal tax on them, and end the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
                            registration requirement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Healthcare &amp; Drug Policy:</strong> Prefers a free-market approach where individuals pay for
                            their own care. Promotes lower-premium HMO options and no employer mandate. Supports Drug Policy
                            Alliance-style response teams for substance crises and Employee Assistance Programs for short-term
                            counseling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abortion:</strong> Believes women should control their reproductive choices and promotes the
                            National Network of Abortion Funds to expand access through awareness and support.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Environment:</strong> Seeks to counter rising sea levels, climate change, and ocean
                            acidification by regulating emissions, promoting renewable energy, and incentivizing sustainable
                            infrastructure through grants, subsidies, and tax breaks such as those in the Inflation Reduction
                            Act.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Criminal Justice Reform:</strong> Calls for ending mass incarceration via restorative
                            justice, lower sentences, and alternative punishment for nonviolent offenders, emphasizing
                            rehabilitation and community supervision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Education:</strong> Argues federal control stifles innovation. Supports a decentralized,
                            free-market system with family choice, expanded charter schools, voucher programs, and fewer
                            regulations on private schools to boost creativity and competition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nuclear Ocean Testing:</strong> Backs a worldwide ban through ratifying the Comprehensive
                            Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and allowing damaged ecosystems to recover naturally from past testing.
                        </p>

                            end funding for Israel and Ukraine, push ceasefires and negotiations, and emphasize market access

                            Korean peninsula while building regional defense systems. Supports the DREAM Act and more resources
                            for the Office of Refugee Resettlement to help refugees integrate and contribute.
