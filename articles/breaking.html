                            Krabby Party vice president candidate Sandy Cheeks was shot in the leg during the party’s press conference this afternoon, prompting a rushed evacuation and urgent questions about security around the ticket.

                    <h2>On-Air Breaking News Transcript (Larry the Lobster)</h2>
                    <blockquote>
                        Breaking news. Krabby Party vice president candidate Sandy Cheeks was just shot in the leg during the party's press conference. Sandy was in the process of answering questions from the audience when secret service stepped in the way and a bullet flew past. Secret service had stepped out of the way of Sandy, thinking that the threat was gone, when a second shot hit Sandy in the leg. In the chaos following the shot, Sandy fired back at a member of the media and said, and I quote, “You b-word!” Sandy was rushed to the hospital and seems to be in better condition now. This is Larry the Lobster, signing off.

                    <h2>How This Happened</h2>
                    <p>
                        Eyewitnesses say the press conference was proceeding normally until the first gunshot rang out.

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        The shooting underscores voter anxiety about safety at campaign events and could renew debate over the Krabby Party’s gun-rights platform. Both campaigns face pressure to show they can protect their tickets and audiences.

                        Officials are expected to brief reporters once Sandy’s condition stabilizes and investigators review venue security. BBBC will update viewers as new details emerge.
