                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bikini Bottom Broadcasting Center (BBBC) is committed to delivering fair, accurate, and comprehensive
                        coverage of the presidential election. As the premier news source for our underwater community,
                        we serve three critical roles in our democracy: Scorekeeper, Gatekeeper, and Watchdog.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Scorekeeper</h2>
                    <p>
                        We track the pulse of the election, monitoring polling data, campaign momentum, and public sentiment.
                        Our team conducts thorough polls and presents clear, unbiased data to help voters understand where
                        candidates stand and how public opinion is shaping the race.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Gatekeeper</h2>
                    <p>
                        As gatekeepers of information, we determine what is newsworthy and how to present critical campaign
                        events to the public. We frame stories with context and accuracy, ensuring that voters receive the
                        information they need to make informed decisions. From campaign rallies to policy announcements,
                        we bring you the stories that matter most.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Watchdog</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our investigative team works tirelessly to hold candidates accountable. We examine their records,
                        investigate claims, and expose any corruption, scandal, or misleading information. Our watchdog role
                        ensures transparency in the democratic process and helps voters see beyond campaign rhetoric to
                        understand the truth about each candidate.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Values</h2>
