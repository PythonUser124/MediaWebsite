                            <li>Which environmental action should come first: rejoining the Paris Agreement, emissions limits, or tax incentives for sustainable business?</li>
                            <li>How should we reform criminal justice: mental health investment and alternative sentencing or traditional incarceration approaches?</li>

                    <h2>Candidate Responses to Poll Results</h2>
                    <div class="polling-section">
                        <h3>Patty Party Response</h3>
                        <p>
                            A Patty Party spokesperson celebrated SpongeBob and Patrick capturing 85.2% of the vote, noting the ticket’s
                            kindness-first platform. When asked about the weak showing for decriminalizing minor offenses (15.4%), the
                            campaign said they will emphasize safeguards and pair diversion with the widely supported expansion of mental
                            health resources (84.6%) to reassure safety-minded voters.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Krabby Party Response</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Krabby Party acknowledged trailing with 14.8% support and recognized that their individual-purchase healthcare
                            plan drew only 11.1% approval. They signaled openness to blending employer incentives and cost caps while keeping
                            market choice, aiming to regain voters who favored the Patty Party’s government-funded approach (81.5%).

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>
                            SpongeBob and Patrick hold a commanding lead fueled by personal likability and policies tied to government-backed
                            support (healthcare, social welfare, and environmental commitments). Voters favor regulation and safety over
                            laissez-faire approaches on guns, healthcare, and nuclear issues. Economic and immigration preferences show some
                            appetite for the Krabby ticket’s pro-business and streamlined citizenship ideas, suggesting room for movement if
                            the campaign pivots toward affordability and collaboration. The biggest red flags for each side are the Patty
                            Party’s decriminalization plank and the Krabby Party’s healthcare stance—areas where nuance and compromise could
                            meaningfully shift future tracking polls.
