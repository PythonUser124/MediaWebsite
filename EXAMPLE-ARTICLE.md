<p class="intro-paragraph">
    In an exclusive sit-down interview at the Krusty Krab, presidential candidate
    SpongeBob SquarePants opened up about his vision for America, his working-class
    roots, and why he believes his optimism is exactly what the country needs right now.
    Over the course of our 30-minute conversation, the Patty Party candidate proved
    both earnest and surprisingly well-informed on key policy issues.

<h2>Interview Transcript</h2>
<p>
    <strong>BBNN:</strong> Thank you for sitting down with us today, SpongeBob.
    Let's start with something voters want to know: Why are you running for president?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SpongeBob SquarePants:</strong> Well, Squidward, I've spent my entire life
    working at the Krusty Krab, and I've seen firsthand how hard working-class Americans
    struggle every day. I make minimum wage, I know what it's like to worry about bills,
    and I know that feeling of working your hardest but still not getting ahead. I'm
    running because I believe every American deserves a chance to live their best life,
    and right now, too many people are being left behind.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>BBNN:</strong> Your opponent, Mr. Krabs, argues that his business experience
    makes him better qualified to manage the economy. How do you respond?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SpongeBob:</strong> I have tremendous respect for Mr. Krabs - I've worked
    for him for years! But I think there's a difference between running a business and
    running a country. A business is about making profit, but a country is about making
    sure everyone has opportunity. I've seen how Mr. Krabs makes decisions, and while
    they're great for his wallet, I'm not sure they'd be great for every American's
    wallet. The presidency isn't about being the richest or the most successful business
    owner - it's about serving the people.
</p>

## More Examples of Good Content

### Good Investigative Report Opening
```
BBNN Investigation reveals that presidential candidate Mr. Krabs has a troubling
history of workplace violations. Documents obtained by our investigative team show
that the Krusty Krab has been cited 47 times by the health department over the past
decade for various code violations. While the candidate touts his business acumen,
our investigation raises questions about whether his management style prioritizes
profit over people's wellbeing.
```

### Good Breaking News Lead
```
🚨 BREAKING: In a stunning development at tonight's press conference, vice presidential
candidate Patrick Star struggled to answer basic questions about foreign policy, at one
point asking reporters "What's a foreign?" The moment, captured on live television, has
sent shockwaves through the Patty Party campaign and raised new questions about the
ticket's readiness for office.
```

### Good Candidate Profile Opening
```
Sandy Cheeks didn't come to Bikini Bottom to run for vice president. The Texas-born
scientist came to pursue her research and prove that land creatures and sea creatures
could work together. But somewhere along the way, her inventions, her determination,
and her unique perspective caught the attention of presidential candidate Mr. Krabs.
Now, she stands one election away from becoming the first land mammal to serve in
the vice presidency - a barrier-breaking candidacy that could reshape American politics.
```

### Good Human Interest Story
```
The crowd fell silent as SpongeBob SquarePants knelt down to talk to 8-year-old
Tommy, a young starfish who had been waiting for hours to meet the presidential
candidate. "My dad lost his job," Tommy said quietly, "and now we might lose our
house." SpongeBob's smile faded, replaced by genuine concern. "What's your dad's
name?" he asked. For the next ten minutes, the campaign schedule was forgotten as
SpongeBob listened to Tommy's story, wrote down his father's information, and
promised to help however he could. It's a moment that reveals something the polls
and policy papers can't: who SpongeBob SquarePants really is when the cameras
aren't rolling.
